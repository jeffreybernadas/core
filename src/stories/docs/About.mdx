# About the Project and Creator

## 👋 **Hello!**

I'm a Software Engineer based in the Philippines. This project represents my journey into library development, maintenance, documentation, and open-source contribution (hopefully).

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

This project combines two exciting aspects of modern web development:

1. **NPM Package Development**

   - Learning the complete lifecycle of package creation
   - Implementing automated publishing workflows
   - Building maintainable and reusable code
   - Creating comprehensive documentation (this one, Storybook)

2. **Microfrontend Architecture**
   - Exploring modular frontend development
   - Implementing scalable architecture
   - Integrating with modern development practices
   - Sharing components, hooks (if applicable), and utilities across applications

## 🌱 **Growth & Learning**

This project is more than just code—it's my way of learning and growing as a developer:

- Learning library maintenance best practices
- Understanding package publishing workflows
- Proper documentation
- Building a developer-friendly ecosystem
- Contributing to open-source (hopefully)

## 🤝 **Future Goals**

Moving forward, I aim to:

- Create, maintain, and improve my libraries
- Create new, useful packages (or just "yet another" package 😂)
- Contribute to other open-source projects (hopefully)
- Learn more, more, and more!
