# Disclaimer

This utility library is intentionally minimal and focused. It contains only specific, personally crafted utilities that:

- Are not readily available in established utility libraries
- Solve unique use cases in my projects
- Provide opinionated implementations for common patterns

## 🔍 Recommended Alternatives

For comprehensive utility needs, I highly recommend using established libraries:

- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) - Functional programming utilities
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - The gold standard for JavaScript utilities
- [radash](https://radash-docs.vercel.app/) - Modern utility library focused on TypeScript
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - Modern JavaScript date utility library
- [just](https://github.com/angus-c/just) - A library of dependency-free utilities

## 🎯 My Focus

The utilities provided here are:

- Highly specific to my use cases
- Not meant to replace comprehensive utility libraries
- Designed to complement existing solutions
- Thoroughly tested and documented
- TypeScript-first implementations

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

- Always check if your needed utility exists in established libraries first
- Use my utilities only for specific use cases not covered elsewhere
- Consider contributing to existing libraries instead of adding new utilities here
- Follow the documentation patterns when adding new utilities
